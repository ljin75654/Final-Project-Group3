## Introduction

This project addresses an image classification problem, and further application of the image classification explored in class. The IAM Handwriting Dataset chosen for this project is comprised of a collection of handwritten passages by various writers. The goal of this project is to use deep learning to classify the writers by their writing styles. The results of this project can be used in future applications, such as identifying criminals by signature in fraudulent cases. This report will discuss the dataset, network and training algorithm, experiment setup, results, and conclusions drawn from this analysis.

## Requirements 
This program runs on GPU. 

## Group-Proposal
The proposal covers the following questions:</br>
What problem was selected and why it was selected?</br>
What database/dataset was used? Was it large enough to train a deep network?</br>
What deep network was used?</br>
What framework was used to implement the network? Why?</br>
What reference materials were used to obtain sufficient background on applying thechosen network to the specific problem that you selected?</br>
How to judge the performance of the network? What metrics was used?</br>

## Final-Group-Project-Report
The report covers the following topics:
